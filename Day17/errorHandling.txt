Python uses try and except to handle errors gracefully. A graceful exit (or graceful handling) of errors is a simple programming idiom - a program detects a serious error condition and "exits gracefully", in a controlled manner as a result. Often the program prints a descriptive error message to a terminal or log as part of the graceful exit, this makes our application more robust. The cause of an exception is often external to the program itself. An example of exceptions could be an incorrect input, wrong file name, unable to find a file, a malfunctioning IO device. Graceful handling of errors prevents our applications from crashing.

try:
    code in this block if things go well
except:
    code in this block run if things go wrong
