Python is an object oriented programming language. Everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A number, string, list, dictionary, tuple, set etc. used in a program is an object of a corresponding built-in class. We create class to create an object. A class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects. We instantiate a class to create an object. The class defines attributes and the behavior of the object, while the object, on the other hand, represents the class.

Like the constructor function in Java or JavaScript, Python has also a built-in init() constructor function. The init constructor function has self parameter which is a reference to the current instance of the class.

Inheritance
Using inheritance we can reuse parent class code. Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from parent class. The parent class or super or base class is the class which gives all the methods and properties. Child class is the class that inherits from another or parent class. Let us create a student class by inheriting from person class.
