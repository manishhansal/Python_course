Pandas is an open source, high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. Pandas adds data structures and tools designed to work with table-like data which is Series and Data Frames. Pandas provides tools for data manipulation:

reshaping
merging
sorting
slicing
aggregation
imputation. If you are using anaconda, you do not have install pandas.

Pandas data structure is based on Series and DataFrames.

A series is a column and a DataFrame is a multidimensional table made up of collection of series. In order to create a pandas series we should use numpy to create a one dimensional arrays or a python list.

Data frame is a collection of rows and columns.

Modifying a DataFrame
Modifying a DataFrame: * We can create a new DataFrame * We can create a new column and add it to the DataFrame, * we can remove an existing column from a DataFrame, * we can modify an existing column in a DataFrame, * we can change the data type of column values in the DataFrame

Creating a DataFrame
As always, first we import the necessary packages. Now, lets import pandas and numpy, two best friends ever.
