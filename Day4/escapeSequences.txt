=> In Python and other programming languages \ followed by a character is an escape sequence. Let us see the most common escape characters:

\n: new line
\t: Tab means(8 spaces)
\\: Back slash
\': Single quote (')
\": Double quote (")

=> String formatting
Old Style String Formatting (% Operator)
In Python there are many ways of formatting strings. In this section, we will cover some of them. The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s", "%d", "%f", "%.number of digitsf".

%s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)
%d - Integers
%f - Floating point numbers
"%.number of digitsf" - Floating point numbers with fixed precision

=> String Interpolation / f-Strings (Python 3.6+)
Another new string formatting is string interpolation, f-strings. Strings start with f and we can inject the data in their corresponding positions.
